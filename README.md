# Heart-Damage-Prediction

# Description
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death globally, responsible for an estimated 17.9 million deaths annually, accounting for 31% of all deaths worldwide. Most CVD deaths result from heart attacks and strokes, with one-third occurring prematurely in individuals under 70. Heart failure, a frequent outcome of CVDs, necessitates early detection and management, especially for those at high cardiovascular risk due to factors like hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidaemia. Machine learning models can significantly aid in the early identification and management of these high-risk individuals, improving outcomes and reducing premature deaths from heart disease.
## Overview
This project aims to prepare a comprehensive data analysis report, develop a machine learning model to predict potential heart diseases, and provide suggestions to the hospital for implementing predictive measures to prevent life-threatening conditions.
